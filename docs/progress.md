# Current progress

Updated: 2026-07-27

## Active milestone

StoryForge Gate F is complete on
`codex/phase-1.0a-deepseek-ai-foundation`. Tasks 21-24 passed performance,
responsive/accessibility, migration, recovery, vertical-slice and production
Windows build gates. The first final binary closed normally; the second launch
restored the sanitized real project in read-write mode and remains running.
Final evidence is recorded in
`docs/acceptance/011-storyforge-gate-f-professional-baseline-2026-07-27.md`.

## Open

- Validate `/models`, balance, streaming, cancellation, restart, and deletion
  with a user-provided real DeepSeek key.
- Validate AI automatic chapter review with that key.
- Human cutover gates are intentionally not automated.
- Legacy retirement is forbidden until M9 is complete.

## Next

Gate F is the final supplied implementation gate. Stop and wait for explicit
product scope; live DeepSeek account acceptance requires a user-provided key.
