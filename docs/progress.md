# Current progress

Updated: 2026-07-27

## Active milestone

AI Quick Actions Gate A/B passed automated and local visual acceptance on
`codex/ai-quick-actions-gate-ab`. The round is intentionally limited to the
shared Action/Prompt/output contracts, privacy-aware Context Pack, unified AI
drawer and guarded Preview Transaction. Existing DeepSeek, Story Kernel,
selection rewrite and version services are adapters; no second runtime is
allowed. Gate A is commit `3305500`; Gate B is commit `962b713`. The frozen map
is in
`docs/plans/002-ai-quick-actions-source-map.md` and the capability matrix is in
`docs/plans/003-ai-current-capability-matrix.md`; final evidence is in
`docs/acceptance/013-ai-quick-actions-gate-ab-2026-07-27.md`.

## Open

- Validate `/models`, balance, streaming, cancellation, restart, and deletion
  with a user-provided real DeepSeek key.
- Validate AI automatic chapter review with that key.
- Validate AI Story Kernel generation quality against the user's real
  DeepSeek account and a non-sanitized author-selected chapter.
- Human cutover gates are intentionally not automated.
- Legacy retirement is forbidden until M9 is complete.

## Next

Review and explicitly approve Gate A/B. Do not start concrete editor or Story
module actions before that approval.
